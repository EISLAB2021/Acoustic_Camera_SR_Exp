# About the Project
The acoustic camera is a type of 2D forward-looking sonar (FLS) that can operate in low-visibility underwater environments.
However, the resolution of acoustic images captured by acoustic cameras is very low, which is a common problem in sonar image processing.
Different from the previous CNN-based acoustic image super-resolution (SR) reconstruction, this project tested the reconstruction performance based on GAN.
Ultimately, this project will serve the preprocessing of acoustic camera images together with the denoising project.
